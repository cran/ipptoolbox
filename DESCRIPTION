Description: Uncertainty quantification and propagation in the framework of 
    Dempster-Shafer Theory and imprecise probabilities. This toolbox offers 
    easy-to-use methods for using imprecise probabities for applied uncertainty
    modelling and simulation. The package comprises the basic functionality 
    needed, with usability similar to standard probabilistic analysis:
    - Fit imprecise probability distributions from data,
    - Define imprecise probabilities based on distribution functions,
    - Combine with various aggregation rules (e. g. Dempster's rule),
    - Plotting tools,
    - Propagate through arbitrary functions / simulations via Monte Carlo,
    - Perform sensitivity analyses with imprecise distributions,
    - Example models for a quick start.
